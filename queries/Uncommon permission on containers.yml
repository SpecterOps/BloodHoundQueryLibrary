name: Uncommon permission on containers
guid: 018c2b45-e30f-47d8-a751-22419c3d0736
prebuilt: false
platforms: Active Directory
category: Active Directory Hygiene
description: BloodHound typically identifies risk on Active Directory objects stored in OUs, however behind the scenes; Active Directory has a hieracy of containers e.g. CN=SYSTEM and CN=CONFIGURATION, on which control can lead to risk. Results are prone to false-positives but can assist auditing containers permissions.
