description: BloodHound's ADCS analysis requires collecting CA registry data to increase accuracy/enable more edges. Collection by default requires SharpHound has Administrators membership. Requires SharpHound v2.3.5 or above. It only requires one misconfigured DC to potentially a full forest compromise by any principal. DCs returned by this query have not been collected.
query: |-
  MATCH p=(:Domain)<-[:DCFor]-(c:Computer)
  WHERE c.strongcertificatebindingenforcementraw IS NULL
  // Exclude inactive DCs
  AND c.enabled = true
  AND c.lastlogontimestamp > (datetime().epochseconds - (30 * 86400))
  RETURN p
